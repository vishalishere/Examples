This sample demonstrates how to create apps that take advantage of many media platform features.

Specifically, this sample covers: 
- Playing local video 
- Customizing media transport controls
- Using in-band closed captions in your app
- Using out-of-band closed captions in your app
- Dealing with multiple video tracks
- Dealing with multiple audio tracks

Note:
- Scenarios 3-7 currently crash on mobile devices running ARM chipsets. We will update the sample once this fix is checked in.
