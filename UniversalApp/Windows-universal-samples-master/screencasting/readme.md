This sample demonstrates how to combine different casting technologies into a single user experience. With Windows 10 you can combine reach the broadest set of devices in the market with the following technologies DIAL, Miracast, Bluetooth, and DLNA.

Specifically, this sample covers:


-   How to use the MediaElement and use default casting
-   How to use the MediaElement, the Windows.Media.Casting APIs, and custom transport controls.
-   How to create a sender application to discover and launch an application using the Windows.Media.DialProtocol
-   How to create a receiver application that is being launced using the Windows.Media.DialProtocol APIs
-   How to use the Windows.UI.ViewManagement APIs, and custom transport controls.
-   How to discover and launch an application using the Windows.Media.DialProtocol, Windows.Media.Casting, and Windows.UI.ViewManagement APIs.

Notes:
In AzureMediaProviders.cs there are a few lines commented out that contain a .License property for each video element.  These properties are not valid properties on the object, hence they are commented out.  The copyright attribution, however, is accurate for the various pieces of content.  The attribution will be set up more cleanly in later versions of the sample.
